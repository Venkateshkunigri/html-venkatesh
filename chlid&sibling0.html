        <p><span>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A 
            paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration 
            of a general point.</span> A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. 
            A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph
            and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it.

            Particularly in paragraphs in which you define 
            or identify an important idea or theory, 
            be consistent in how you refer to it. 
        Consistency in point of view, verb tense, and number
         is a subtle but important aspect of coherence.  </span> </p>
